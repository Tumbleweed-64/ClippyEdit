# ClippyEdit
The greatest text editor made.

Welcome, fellow developers! I have created a new text editor. What's so special about this, you may ask? Well, as evidenced by the title, It has the special inclusion of our old Windows friend, Clippy. Keep in mind you will either need version 7 of the dotnet framework or just change the number in the <code>.csproj</code> from 7 to whatever the version is when you find this thing.

He takes up a good quarter of the screen and makes annoying comments at random. Soon, he will be able to help you more with your development needs by finding a StackOverflow link based on your problems (all without using AI!) You see, ClippyEdit is the text editor that has Clippy integrated into it. You can't get rid of him, and why would you? He's perfect!

# Features

- The ability to save and load files (Well, that's a given, it's a text editor)
- Light and dark modes (Theme packs coming soon!)
- The special "ðŸ“Ž" button. This can do a number of things, discussed in a second.

# What does the "ðŸ“Ž" button do?

That button can do some weird stuff. Some of it is not complete yet, however. Right now it can:

- Switch the editor to Hot Dog Stand theme.
- Say a randomly chosen joke, from a personal selection of ones from Gex: Enter the Gecko. ([full list found here](https://gex.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_quotes_in_Gex:_Enter_the_Gecko))
- Cause a fake error, some conventional, some esoteric.

# What I need to add

Even with the excellent quality of the editor right now, I'd like to put in some more features. They are listed below.

- Theme packs
- An API so the great fans of this great project can add some features
- Finish the features on the "ðŸ“Ž" button
- Fix a bug with the Hot Dog Stand theme that interferes with the other themes
- Give Clippy some more jokes. These should trigger when you load a file, try to write, and other inconvienient times for someone to be making fun of your writing in some way.
- I will be rewriting this soon with Java, but the old repo will still be kept here if anybody wants the classic experience. Note that you will need the dotnet runtime version 7-something, I believe, because C# is very pushy about that for some reason. I wish I could make Clippy say some more stuff, but I'm on Linux now and I have no idea how to install dotnet :P. As I said, I will remake in in Java and hopefully make it even better, but Swing is a little wacky.
